Compensator-Receiver.jsfx receives a reference signal on the sidechain (e.g., channels 2/3) and dynamically adjusts the levels of the input signal (1/2) to match the reference.\line
Loudness detection by RMS, Peaks, LUFS-M, LUFS-S is supported. There are numerous tuning parameters that allow you to tailor the Compensator's behavior to different material. All controls are provided with tooltips that appear at the bottom of the window when you touch the corresponding slider/switch.\line
There's also a reference signal monitoring option for quick A/B comparisons (e.g., signal before a VST chain VS processed and gain matched signal).\line
You can also use several Compensators in sequence, for example, using the "main" LUFS-M first, followed by the "fast and rough" RMS with a short detector window and a high activation threshold (Return-to-Zero parameter), so that it only suppresses sudden volume changes to which the first Compensator doesn't have time to react quickly.\line
The auxiliary Compensator-Sender.jsfx allows you to quickly create a route to sidechain channels. Put Sender before your VST chain, Receiver after it, and set the same "Reference channels".\line
