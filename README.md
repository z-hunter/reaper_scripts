# My scripts for Cockos Reaper DAW

## Extract Chords from Selected Audio Item (Chordino) â€” REAPER ReaScript

*ExtractChordsFromAudio.lua*

### What is this?

This ReaScript for REAPER automatically extracts chords from a selected audio item (e.g., guitar, keyboard, or even full mix) and creates a dedicated track with chord names as text items.  
It leverages [Sonic Annotator](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/sonic-annotator/) and the [Chordino VAMP plugin](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/plugin-doc/qm-vamp-plugins.html#id6).
